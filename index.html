    <p>Hey, Gob:</p>
    <p>I can’t believe you’re over at Shopify now! 😮 ✋ I still remember when you were sawing 👩 in half over at the Playtime Pizza Theater. You’re pretty awesome 👏 & I’m a huge fan. I think we’re quite similar. 👬  We both 💚 to make people 😀. You do it through incredible , and I do it through software.</p>

    <p>As a open source developer, I 💚 environments that foster sharing and  over profit-seeking. Most of my time is spent working on exciting projects to help people (👥), after all, it’s all about 👥. I love to learn and teach, which I have recently combined into a business along with my love for helping 👥. It started off as 😡 I had when I taught a course for the first time last summer. We call ourselves PLADO. We help create classrooms where 👥 💛  to  for the purpose of  & teachers get hired because they 💙 what they do, not for their degrees (😧  crazy, right?). Through this initiative, we’ve all learned so much including how to run a hackathon on a startup budget.</p>
    <p>I won’t bore you with the details of my work experience 💤, I’ll let my resume do that. But I’m not the superman 💪  of development but I’m always reading about new things. I’d love to work at Shopify because I think it’s really great that you guys promote growth mindsets  over fixed mindsets - it’s something I’m trying to overcome in myself. I only learned about these things recently when I met one of your recruiters, Katie Slater 👩, at deCODE 2017 and got to work with more Shopify 👥. You see, this isn’t my first time applying. Last time, I didn’t include a cover letter - unfortunately, that meant I didn’t make the cut. It was then that I realized ...</p>

    <p>But deCODE 2017 was an awesome experience and I hope I get to work with more cool 👥 like that. 😊 I’d love to get another chance, just like how The Alliance of Magicians gave you another chance . I’ve grown over the last few months and for me, this opening at Shopify is an opportunity to grow even more.</p>
    <p class="right">Can't wait to hear from you,</p>
